# Time-and-Date-
A easy Website to show the Time and Date by using Javascript.
It's another Website to get mor familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. The website have the functionality I wanted. The code is not so clean and I think because the position of the setInterval function have the time 1000 the site is very slow. You can easly fast it up when you decrease this value.
